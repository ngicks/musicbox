// The returned Reader stores a first error encountered,
// including EOF and context cancellation.
// If any error has occurred, any subsequent Read calls always return same error.
//
// The context cancellation prevents afterwards Read calls from actually reading the underlying r.
// However that does not mean that it would unblock already blocking Read calls (e.g. reading sockets, terminals, etc.)
// If r is possible to block long and you wish to unblock it in that case,
// r itself must be cancellable by its own mean.
// For files, you can combine os.Pipe and platform specific poll functions,
// for example, epoll for Linux, kqueue for Mac OS.
//
// The returned Reader is not goroutine safe.
// Calling Read multiple times simultaneously may cause undefined behaviors.
